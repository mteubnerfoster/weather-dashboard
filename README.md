# Weather Dashboard
For this project, I built a weather dashboard that displays cities' weather forecasts.

* This is a weather dashboard with form inputs.
* When users search for a city, they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.
* Users are presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index when they view current weather conditions for that city.
* When users view the UV index, they are presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.
* Users are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity when they view future weather conditions for that city.
* When users click on a city in the search history, they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city.
